The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that promote the creation of flexible, maintainable, and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming. The SOLID acronym stands for:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
   - Each class or module should focus on doing one thing and doing it well, promoting maintainability and minimizing the impact of changes.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - New functionality should be added through the creation of new code rather than altering existing code, allowing for easier updates and extensions without affecting existing, working code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
   - Subtypes (derived or child classes) must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - Objects of a base class should be replaceable with objects of a derived class without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - Instead of having large, monolithic interfaces, it is better to have smaller, more specific interfaces, tailored to the needs of the clients.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
   - High-level modules (e.g., business logic) should not depend on low-level modules (e.g., data access), but both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
   - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
   - This principle promotes decoupling, flexibility, and the ease of substituting components without affecting the overall system.

By adhering to the SOLID principles, developers aim to create code that is more modular, maintainable, and adaptable to change, fostering better software design practices.
